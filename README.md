A way to access Google APIs via
[Google API Discovery service](https://developers.google.com/discovery/). Use
the discovery tool in either of two ways:

- _Dynamic_: Create a function wrapper at runtime.

- _Code generation_: Generate a `.rkt` file and (still TO-DO) `.scrbl`
  file to be the basis of a library that a human will review and push
  to PLaneT and/or GitHub.


To use:

1. Get an API key from Google's
[API Console](https://code.google.com/apis/console/).

2. Put your Google API key in a `~/.google-api-key` file.
